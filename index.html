    <td>  <p>Unique classic framing for your painting - hand painted art frames that reflect colors and subject of the painting. The frame can contain also your thoughts about the painting, matching poetry or your motto.
    This is the traditional way in which European paintings of XVII-XIX centuries were framed.
